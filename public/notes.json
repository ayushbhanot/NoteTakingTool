  ],
  "Cell Biology Basics": [
    "- Cells are basic units of life with genetic information (DNA) and cell membrane (phospholipid bilayer).",
    "- Two cell types: eukaryotes (nucleus and organelles) and prokaryotes (no nucleus or organelles).",
    "- Plant cells have chloroplasts for photosynthesis and larger vacuoles."
